# csa-official-website-react
A newly optimized variant of the Official CSA Website, utilizing ReactJS over ExpressJS.

## Description
As Ambassadors, our mission is to serve as a platform for a more collaborative, inclusive, and unified computer science community. We achieve this by encouraging and fostering a diverse community of students through peer mentorship, community-building events, and support from the computer science student-led organizations. Ultimately, we want to foster and encourage a diverse community, serving as a social network to qualify the BU CS experience as a whole.

## Tech Stack
This website is an HTML/SCSS/JS website that utilizes a Node.js/React.js back-end for server-side processes. Be sure to download Node and npm ([found here](https://nodejs.org/en/)). Rellax.js was used for the parallax effect. Most of the mobile responsiveness of the website uses flexbox and the Contact Us page uses Grid CSS. Nodemailer is used for the contact form.

## Installation
After cloning the repository, run the following command to enter the development environment.
```
npm start
```

## Deployment
Any push or merge to branch "prod" will automatically deploy to https://csa-official-website.herokuapp.com/ with Heroku.
